This is a very simple java quiz app, just to practice some quick fundamentals of Java.

Here I have used some concepts like

1. Taking user input

2. Display questions in the console

3. Classes an Objects concept to create qustions from a seperate class, which will be called from the Main.java, to make the code less cluttered.
